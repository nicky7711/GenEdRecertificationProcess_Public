GenEd Recertification Process is an automation of GenEd recertification system by providing a streamlined process for the submission, renewal, evaluation of course portfolio.
Because of security concerns, WebConfig, WebService, database connection information, personal information, and any other credential file/information are not available, which means this project will not be running properly.
